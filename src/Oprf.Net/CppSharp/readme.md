# NOTE

CppSharp (MIT license) is used to generate the interop code with the Sodium Library.

The CppSharp NuGet package has a weird, unstated dependency on netcoreapp3.1, which this library should not.

These files in the CppSharp folder have been copied from https://github.com/mono/CppSharp/tree/main/src and modified minimally to comply with the required styles and Nullable Reference Types.
